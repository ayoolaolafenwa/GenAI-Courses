# How Multimodal Large Language Model Works
![multimodalai](images/Multimodal/multimodalai.png)
Multimodal LLM is an advanced large language model (LLM) designed to process and interpret various modalities such as text, images, and audio. It is used for tasks that go beyond text processing, such as answering questions based on documents, analyzing speech inputs, and describing image contents. Popular multimodal models include GPT-4 Vision, Gemini, Phi-4 Multimodal, and LLaMA Vision.

### Working of A Basic Multimodal Model
Most multimodal models operate in the following manner: there is a base language model, such as GPT, which processes text and integrates other modalities through the interaction of an encoder, an adapter, and language integration mechanisms. A multimodal model that handles text and images typically works as follows:

* Image Encoder: It is a deep neural network responsible for converting raw images into high-dimensional feature vectors known as image embeddings. These embeddings contains extracted information from the image. Some of the commonly used image encoders in multimodal models are CLIP, SigLIP.

* Adapter: The image embeddings from the image encoder is not compatible directly with a language model. Adapter is used to adapt image embeddings into the format compatible with the language model. The type of image adapter depend on the architecture of a multimodal model. It can be in the form of a module such as a linear projection to scale the dimension of the image embeddings to match the expected dimension for the language model. The image adapter makes it possible for a language model to treat images as text tokens.

* Language Integration: The adapted embeddings are integrated into the language model. This model combines the visual and textual information to produce the desired output.

This approach is used in solving different multimodal tasks such as:

Image Captioning: Generating a textual description of an image.

Visual Question Answering: Answering a question about an image.

Image-Text Retrieval: Matching images with relevant text descriptions.
